Simple demos about how to use Android SQLite CRUD

### greenDAO
[GreenDAO](http://greenrobot.org/greendao/) is an open source ORM for Android that helps database development with SQLite. We can use it to store, update, delete and query data for java objects on database tables, which help save developement time while we ignore the low-level database requirements.
So, in order to using greenDAO in my projects, I tried to make a simple demo for learning CRUD methonds in branch [greenDAO-demo](https://github.com/CrazyPudding/ExerciseAboutAndroidSQLite/tree/greenDAO-demo).
